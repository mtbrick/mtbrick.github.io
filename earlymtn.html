				<div class-"col-md-12"><p>Early Mountain Vineyards is a luxury vineyard that lays at the northern end of the Monticello Wine Trail in Madison, Virginia. Owned by former AOL executives, Steve and Jean Case, Early Mountain is dedicated to helping guests experience portfolio, place, passion, people, and purpose in a relaxing envrionment. Featuring a Best of Virginia program, Early Mountain supports the entirely of the Vrignia wine industry by partnering with other wineries in the state to offer a wider array of experience and tastes for consumers. The winery also approaches tastings in a unique form that is unlike its competitors, where pre-arranged flights of wine have been set by the staff to highlight a specific season or purpose to maximize enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>
				<p>Early Mountain was my first foray into the Virginia wine industry, and I have been hooked ever since. While I was unable to pour and taste the wine at my time of employment, I developed my knowledge of winemaking by supplementing it with local food pairings. During this time, I was responible for expertly serving food and wine to guests while educating them on its local origins and ensuring their enjoyment. I also volunteered to spend time alongside the Kitchen Manager and Associates in the creation of seasonal dishes that would pair well with featured wine flights. This experience brought to life my passion for the Virginia wine and my determination to stay involved in the industry throughout my residence in the state.</p>
