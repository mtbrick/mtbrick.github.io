					<h3>Cafe Attendant</h3>

				<div class-"col-md-12"><p>Attimo Winery was one of the first established vineyards in the Southwest Virgnia area. Attimo, meaning "in the moment" in Italian, was dedicated to helping all patrons appreciate the little moments in life. Each wine was named for, and inspirted by, a different experience or event. In the summer of 2015, Attimo was purchased and rebranded under the name Whitebarrel Winery, and continues to be a successful favorite in the local community.</p>
				<p>I  served as their sole Cafe Attendant from Feburary 2015 to May 2015 during my junior year at Virginia Tech. I was singularly responsible for opening, operating, and closing the cafe portion of the winery. I also assisted in the execution of various festivals and events by collaborating with fellow team members. During this time, I received both ServSafe Food Service and TIPS Alcohol Service certifications.</p>
