					<h3>Event Sales and Marketing Intern</h3>
					<p>May 2015 - August 2015 | North Garden, Virginia</p>

				<div class-"col-md-12"><p>Pippin Hill Farm and Vineyards is a luxury winery and premier wedding destination located approximately 15 minutes away from the heart of Charlottesville, Virginia. The property was skillfully crafted by husband-and-wife duo Lynn Easton and Dean Porter Andrews as a culmination of their years of experience and expertise in the hospitality industry. Nestled at the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, Pippin Hill captures the classic charm of a rustic Virginian farm in a picturesque location that easily sells itself to clients in search of a unique and timeless wedding destination.</p>
				<p>I served as the Event Sales and Marketing Intern at Pippin Hill from May to August of 2015. In this position, I assisted in planning and implementation of luxury weddings and corporate events, created instrumental client databases and restructured marketing of services, planned and executed training seminars for tasting room and banquet staff, and provided creative support and copyediting for published brochures and documents. I completed this intership for academic credit in the form of a field study for the Hospitality and Tourism Management department at Virginia Tech. Final projects regarding event marketing and operations can be found here.</p>
