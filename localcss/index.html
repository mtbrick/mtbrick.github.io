					<p>There are a few key attributes my close friends and family would use to accurately paint a picture of who I am. Perceptive. Straight-forward. Defiant. From a very young age, I have been challening myself and constantly pushing boundaries, which has led me to develop a unique sense of resourcefulness and an initiative drive unlike that of my peers. My high degree of emotional intelligence gives me strong sense of self and an unwavering confidence that results in an inherent comfort no matter my surroundings.  </p>
					<p>Currently, I am seeking full-time employment upon my impending graduation from Virginia Tech on May 13, 2016. I am in pursuit of a fast-paced, professional environment that will ultimately provide a platform through which I can successfully merge my creative instincts and astute eye for detail with my analytical mind and logical tendencies. Please take the time to browse through my academic and workplace acheivements.</p>
					<p>If you would like to be in contact, feel free to reach out -- I am always looking to expand my interests and further hone my skills through new opportunities and experiences.</p>
					<p>I can always be found at mtbrick@vt.edu or (434) 566-9321.</p>
