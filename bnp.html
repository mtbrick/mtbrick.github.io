					<h3>Staff Supervisor</h3>

				<div class-"col-md-12"><p>Bounce-n-Play of Charlottesville is the city's only family entertainment center, featuring unique, all-encompassing birthday party packages, a full-service cafe, and bounce equipment rentals. Bounce-n-Play is also home to retail space, The Funky Monkey, housing gifts from small to large for children of all ages and interests. The facility is a multi-time award winner in Charlottesville for being the premier place to host a party or a rainy day outing.</p>
				<p>Bounce-n-Play provided a fantastic foundation for me to begin developing my professional skill set. I began my time with the local company as a high school student and continued working as a Staff Supervisor throughout my first year of college. I was able to hold many responsibilities while working alongside the General Manager to delegate relevant tasks to the staff members. In this position, I managed party operations, front desk operations, and customer relations as I was trusted to perform daily duties as the manager-on-duty. I conducted prospective employee interviews and trained new additions to the team, and assited the adminstrative staff by drafting and editing all professional letters and emails.</p>
