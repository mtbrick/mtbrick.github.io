					<p>I will graduate from Virginia Tech on May 13, 2016 after spending the previous four years working towards my Bachelor of Science degree in Business with a major in Hospitality and Tourism Management. During this time, I completed courses in accounting, finance, and marketing alongside major-specific classes that instructed me about successful management of the hospitality industry. I also received a minor in Professional and Technical writing. My extensive education at Virginia Tech has provided me with a solid foundation upon which I have begun to develop my professional skill set and a comfortable and rewarding atmosphere that has fostered a great deal of personal growth. </p>
